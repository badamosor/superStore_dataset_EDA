# Summary

This notebook reveals key insights into sales and profits of Super Store dataset. California and New York showed the highest profits, while states like Texas and Ohio incurred losses. Technology and Office Supplies were the most popular and profitable categories overall, though the most profitable products varied by state. Copiers stood out as the most profitable product, whereas items like Bookcases, Tables, and Supplies often generated losses. Notably, profit margins became negative when discounts exceeded 20%. Office Supplies led in total quantity sold, with steady year-over-year growth, while the average quantity per transaction remained consistent across all categories. Seasonal trends were evident, with both quantity sold and profit increasing in the last last quarter of each year.

For future analysis, deeper investigation into the relationship between discount rates and profit margins is recommended, particularly to identify thresholds where discounting becomes unprofitable across different product types. This could help refine pricing strategies. Additionally, analyzing the correlation between high-discount items and their sales volumes may reveal whether certain products respond better to promotions. Analyzing behavior by region or customer type, could uncover patterns in purchasing preferences. Finally, applying time-series forecasting on sales and profit trends may support more accurate demand planning and inventory optimization.
